# SF Homelessness
--------

Collaborating with Bayes Impact, Ike McCreery and the SF Mayor's Office to construct homelessness metrics.

This project uses the DSSG/DSaPP template: https://github.com/dssg/project_template

## Using

To create a project using this as a template-

1. Create a new repository on Github without a README or LICENSE file.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/dssg/project_template.git`. This adds the template repo as a remote that you can pull from.
4. Run `git pull upstream master`. Pull in all the commits on the template to the current master branch.
5. Run `git push origin master`. Push the template to the github master branch.
6. Replace README.md with one appropriate for your project.
7. Profit!

###Key Concepts

`requirements.txt` should be a text file that contains all the python packages required for this project to be run.

`build.sh` is a shell script that should run your ETL, Run the models and then validate them. *This may be replaced by [Drake](https://github.com/Factual/drake) or Makefiles in the future*.

`config.py` is a config file that lives in the .gitignore, therefore it is not actually in the repo. It is used to hold sensitive info. (env variables, database strings, etc). See Conventions and `config.py.sample` for more

`etl` is the directory in which you should have scripts that take data from your source of truth (typically raw data that has been uploaded to an S3 bucket) and loads it into a Data Warehouse (typically Postgres). It may contain subdirectories for projects that have multiple data sources. For example, an project could have a script/sub-directory for each school distract that provides data.

`exploration` is directory in which visualizations and exploration of the data is preformed. If you are using iPython Notebook, this is where you should put all of your notebooks. If you need to build assets (ie, charts) as part of your build pipeline, you may include stuff from this directory as part of your build pipeline (see above), but typically, is is avoided.

`model` is the directory in which all statistical models live.

`validation` is the directory in which you preform model validation.


## Assumptions

We assume you are running a system with python2.7 and a virtual environment for the project. You may want to consider using VirtualEnvWrapper to manage python virtual environments.

Typically, the project will involve using some sort of data warehouse. Most often, is the is Postgres, but it may also be Amazon S3, Redshift or another type of relational db. Please note in ETL what data warehouse you are using and where the extracted data goes.


## Conventions

All sensitive information should be stored in `config.py`.

If using a [Python Database API](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) compliant database, for example Postgres or MySQL, please store the database connection string as `DB_CONN` in `config.py`.

If using the AWS suite of tools and you need to access the AWS API, store `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` & `AWS_SECRET_KEY` in `config.py`.

If the project involves building a webapp, please place the webapp in a folder entitled `webapp`. It should follow the conventions of whatever framework is used. It maybe useful to have this be a git submodule.

The directory specific README's should be used to explain what is going on in the directory and what is required to run it.
